           The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is America’s civil space program and the
           global leader in space exploration. The agency has a diverse workforce of just under 18,000
           civil servants, and works with many more U.S. contractors, academia, and international and
           commercial partners to explore, discover, and expand knowledge for the benefit of humanity.
           With an annual budget of $23.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2021, which is less than 0.5% of the 
           overall U.S. federal budget, NASA supports more than 312,000 jobs across the United States, 
           generating more than $64.3 billion in total economic output (Fiscal Year 2019). 

            At its 20 centers and facilities across the country – and the only National Laboratory in 
            space – NASA studies Earth, including its climate, our Sun, and our solar system and beyond.
            We conduct research, testing, and development to advance aeronautics, including electric 
            propulsion and supersonic flight. We develop and fund space technologies that will enable 
            future exploration and benefit life on Earth.
            
            NASA also leads a Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes working with U.S. 
            industry, international partners, and academia to develop new technology, and send science 
            research and soon humans to explore the Moon on Artemis missions that will help prepare for 
            human exploration of the Red Planet. In addition to those major missions, the agency shares 
            what it learns so that its information can make life better for people worldwide. 
            For example, companies use NASA discoveries and technologies to create new products for 
            the public. To ensure future success for the agency and the nation, NASA also supports 
            education efforts in STEM with an emphasis on increasing diversity in our future workforce.
