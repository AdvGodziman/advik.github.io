           <section class="pgh">
           <H1>What is it?</H1><BR>
           <P>Extraterrestrial life is life which may occur outside Earth and which did 
            not originate on Earth. </P><BR>

           <P>Extraterrestrial life may exist on planets other than Earth. Such lifeforms would range 
            from simple microorganisms and multicellular organisms similar to animals or plants, to 
            complex alien intelligences akin to humans. When scientists talk about extraterrestrial life, 
            they consider all those types. Although it is possible that extraterrestrial life may have 
            other configurations, scientists use the hierarchy of lifeforms from Earth for simplicity, 
            as it is the only one known to exist.</P><BR>
            
            <H1>How are we trying to know about them?</H1>
            <P>Astrobiology research is taking place because its time has come. Scientists across the 
            country and around the world are diving into origin-of-life and life-beyond-Earth issues 
            and developing exciting and cutting-edge work, but NASA also has an astrobiology “strategy” 
            describing where the agency sees promising lines of research – from the highly specific to 
            the wide and broad — that the agency might support.</P><BR>

            <P>At the heart of astrobiology is yet another basic and unanswered question: What actually 
            is life? One might think after centuries of study that issue would be resolved, for life on 
            Earth at least. Actually, it’s getting increasingly complicated to come up with an answer 
            that takes in all the “lifeforms” discovered and that might have once existed on our planet. 
            One frequently used definition of life is “a self-sustaining system capable of Darwinian 
            evolution.” But there are literally several hundred more.
            </P><BR>

            <P>NASA scientists are encouraging the scientific community to establish a new framework that
                 provides context for findings related to the search for life. Writing in the journal 
                 Nature, they propose creating a scale for evaluating and combining different lines of 
                 evidence that would ultimately lead to answering the ultimate question: Are we alone in 
                 the universe? </P><BR>

            <H1>What is the goal?</H1>
            <p> The ultimate goal of NASA's exoplanet program is to find unmistakable signs of current 
                life on a planet beyond Earth. How soon that can happen depends on two unknowns: the 
                prevalence of life in the galaxy and how lucky we get as we take those first, tentative,
                exploratory steps.</p>

            <p>Our early planet finding missions, such as NASA’s Kepler and its extended incarnation, 
                K2, or the coming James Webb Space Telescope, could yield bare bones evidence of the 
                potentially habitable worlds. James Webb, designed in part to investigate gas giants and 
                super Earths, might find an outsized version of our planet. NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space
                Telescope or the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, could zero in on a distant planet’s
                reflected light to detect the signatures of oxygen, water vapour, or some other powerful 
                indication of possible life.</p><BR>

            <H1>Why is this our goal?</H1>
            <P>Our goal is to find signs of life beyond planet Earth. This is due to many reasons, but the 
               main reason is so that we can counter any invasions if planned by the extraterrestrial
               creatures. Not only that, we can also know about the progress and development of those
               creatures and their nature too. </P><BR>
